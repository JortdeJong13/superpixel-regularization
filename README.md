# Improving segmentation boundary alignment when training on coarse labels

In this repository a PyTorch implementation of the superpixel downsampling operation is provided.
The downsampling operation can be found in the python file [downsample.py](https://github.com/JortdeJong13/superpixel_regularization/blob/main/downsample.py)
